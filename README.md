# Whole-Foods-Project
Identified a need on my team to develop an algorithm using Python to increase efficiency, improve accuracy, and simplify the Whole Foods Restaurant tip distribution to employees.
•	Collaborated with my Computer Science professor at George Mason and other mentors for error analysis.
•	Previous method required extensive manual calculations which made the task highly inefficient and inaccurate
•	Presented my ideas to Whole Foods Regional members as well as store leadership


This project was created during my Freshmen year at George Mason University with inspiration from my Intro to Computer Programming course. I was able to present my idea to store leadership and regional office workers who rewarded my efforts.
